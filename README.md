## Brain Fundamentals

### Neuroplasticity

The brain's remarkable ability to reorganize and adapt:
- **Hebbian Learning** - "Neurons that fire together wire together"
- **Experience-Dependent Plasticity** - How learning reshapes the brain
- **Network Reorganization** - Functional connectivity changes
- **Lifelong Adaptation** - Plasticity across the lifespan

### Neural Oscillations

Understanding brain rhythms and their significance:
- Frequency bands and their functions
- Phase synchronization across networks
- Oscillatory coupling (cross-frequency interactions)
- Clinical implications of dysregulation

### Functional Connectivity

How brain regions communicate and coordinate:
- **Structural Connectivity** - Physical connections (white matter tracts)
- **Functional Connectivity** - Temporal correlations in activity
- **Effective Connectivity** - Causal influences between regions
- **Dynamic Connectivity** - Time-varying network patterns

---

## Network Connectivity Training

### Our Methodology

Unlike traditional surface EEG frequency training, we focus on:

**Deep Brain Structure Targeting:**
- Using sLORETA source localization
- Training connectivity between network nodes
- Optimizing functional integration
- Personalizing based on QEEG assessment

**Holistic Integration:**
- Multi-modal stimulation
- Vagal nerve modulation
- Photobiomodulation enhancement
- PEMF support
- Synchronized sound/light

### Scientific Foundation

Our approach is grounded in:
- Functional connectivity research
- Network neuroscience
- Neuroplasticity principles
- Evidence-based methodologies
