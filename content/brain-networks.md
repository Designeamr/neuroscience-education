# Major Brain Networks: Functional Connectivity Guide üï∏Ô∏è

## Introduction

The brain operates as a complex network of interconnected regions that work together to support cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions. Modern neuroscience has identified several major functional networks that can be mapped using advanced techniques like fMRI, EEG, and **sLORETA** (which we use at Neurofeedback Luxembourg).

## Network Interactions & Integration

### Triple Network Model

**Core Concept:** Psychopathology often involves dysfunction in the balance between:

1. **DMN** (Internal focus)
2. **SN** (Switching/salience detection)
3. **CEN** (External focus, executive control)

**Healthy Balance:**

- CEN active during tasks, suppressed during rest

**Common Dysfunctions:**

**Depression:**

- Underactive CEN (cognitive impairment)
- Poor SN switching

**ADHD:**
- Underactive CEN (attention deficits)
- Interference from DMN during tasks
- Weak SN control

**Anxiety:**
- Overactive SN (hypervigilance)
- DMN bias toward threat-related thoughts
- CEN consumed by worry

**PTSD:**
- Hyperactive SN (threat hypersensitivity)
- DMN intrusions (flashbacks)
- Impaired CEN (poor emotional regulation)
