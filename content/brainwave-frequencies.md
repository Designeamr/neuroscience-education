# Brainwave Frequencies: Complete Guide 🌊

## Introduction

Brain oscillations, or brainwaves, are rhythmic electrical patterns generated by synchronized neuronal activity. These oscillations occur at different frequencies and are associated with distinct mental states, cognitive processes, and states of consciousness.

## Frequency Interactions & Relationships

### Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR)
- **Clinical Marker for ADHD**

- **Normal Range:** Decreases with age
- **Target for neurofeedback:** Normalize ratio

### Alpha/Theta Ratio
- **Arousal indicator**
- **Low ratio:** Drowsiness, underarousal
- **High ratio:** Alert, sometimes over-aroused
- **Crossover point:** Deep meditative/hypnagogic states

### Cross-Frequency Coupling
- **Phase-Amplitude Coupling:** Slow rhythm phase modulates fast rhythm amplitude
- **Theta-Gamma Coupling:** Memory encoding and retrieval
- **Alpha-Beta Coupling:** Attention modulation
