# Brainwave Frequencies: Complete Guide üåä

## Introduction

Brain oscillations, or brainwaves, are rhythmic electrical patterns generated by synchronized neuronal activity. These oscillations occur at different frequencies and are associated with distinct mental states, cognitive processes, and states of consciousness.

## Frequency Interactions & Relationships

### Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR)

- **Normal Range:** Decreases with age
- **Target for neurofeedback:** Normalize ratio

### Alpha/Theta Ratio
- **Arousal indicator**
- **Low ratio:** Drowsiness, underarousal
- **High ratio:** Alert, sometimes over-aroused
- **Crossover point:** Deep meditative/hypnagogic states

### Cross-Frequency Coupling
- **Phase-Amplitude Coupling:** Slow rhythm phase modulates fast rhythm amplitude
- **Theta-Gamma Coupling:** Memory encoding and retrieval
- **Alpha-Beta Coupling:** Attention modulation

**Our Network Approach:**
- Train connectivity patterns between deep brain structures
- Optimize network interactions
- Personalize based on QEEG mapping
- Multi-modal enhancement (photobiomodulation, VNS, PEMF)

**Target Networks:**
- Default Mode Network (DMN) - primarily alpha/theta
- Salience Network (SN) - beta/gamma
- Central Executive Network (CEN) - beta
- Sensorimotor Networks - SMR/alpha
